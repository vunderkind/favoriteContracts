## Yolo Dice
The Yolo Dice project creates tokens as two six-sided dies which can be used to create interesting derivative projects. 

This is a project I've been following for a bit, and I'm super eager to see what happens next. 3,636 tokens were minted and sold in a rapid airdrop, pre-sale and sale event that was done within one hour. 

The dices have rarity scores based on the dice units themselves, their colors and other attributes. 

The contract in this folder inherits from a lot of verified OpenZeppelin libraries and contracts, and it may be worth studying those in isolation. 

Enjoy!
