## Contribute
This is an open source project, and I'm taking suggestions for interesting smart contracts.
### How to contribute
- In the `contracts` folder, create a sub-folder with the name of the contract (eg, a Loot subfolder for a Loot.sol contract)
- Add a readme file to the subfolder with an explanation for the contract and why it's worth studying. Be as descriptive as possible, and use simple language so this repository is accessible for every Solidity experience level. 
- When done, open a PR for review.
